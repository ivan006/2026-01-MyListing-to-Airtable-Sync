# 🧊 2025-12-Airtable-Data-and-Vue-Html-Cacher

A **Vue-based caching service** for websites built with **Vue + Airtable**, designed to improve **performance, SEO, and stability** by caching both **API data** and **fully rendered HTML pages**.

This project is **not the website itself** — it is a **cache management service** that lives *alongside* the target site inside the same webroot.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

```
/webroot
  /            → Target website (Vue + Airtable)
  /cacher      → This caching service (Vue UI + PHP cache engine)
```

* The **target website** lives at the webroot (`/`)
* The **caching service** lives in `/cacher`
* The cacher **reads and writes files into the parent directory**
* Same-origin is assumed (full control of the site)

This allows the service to:

* Fetch live Vue-rendered pages
* Save static HTML directly into the site
* Proxy and cache Airtable API requests safely

---

## 🔹 What This Service Does

The system manages **five cache strategies**, split across **data caching** and **HTML caching**.

---

## 📦 DATA CACHING

### 1️⃣ Data – Simple Data Cache

A **generic HTTP proxy cache** used primarily for Airtable API calls.

**Features**

* URL + method–based caching
* Supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
* Optional forced regeneration
* Header passthrough
* OAuth support
* Attachment/image proxying

**Use cases**

* Avoid Airtable rate limits
* Cache image attachments
* Speed up repeated API calls

---

### 2️⃣ Data – Page Binder Cache

A **dataset compiler** for Airtable.

**What it does**

* Fetches *all paginated pages* from Airtable
* Merges them into **one JSON file**
* Stores compile metadata (record count, duration, source URL)
* Optionally pre-caches attachments via the data proxy

**Use cases**

* Large Airtable tables (100–10k+ records)
* Predictable, fast-loading datasets
* Reduced client-side pagination logic

---

## 🧊 HTML CACHING (STATIC FREEZING)

All HTML caching is done by:

1. Rendering the Vue page in an iframe
2. Extracting the final DOM
3. Writing `/slug/index.html` into the **parent webroot**

---

### 3️⃣ HTML – Cache from URL

* Cache a single Vue route
* Saves rendered HTML to disk
* Cleans output by removing:

  * JSON-LD
  * canonical links
  * OG / Twitter meta
  * Google Tag Manager

**Use cases**

* SEO-critical landing pages
* Manual page freezing

---

### 4️⃣ HTML – Cache from List

* Uses a predefined `pages.json`
* Allows multi-select
* Cache or delete pages in bulk
* Homepage handled with backup/restore logic

**Use cases**

* Controlled, explicit page caching
* Editorial or curated sites

---

### 5️⃣ HTML – Cache from Sitemap

* Reads sitemap URLs from `sitemaps.json`
* Supports:

  * Normal sitemaps (`<urlset>`)
  * Sitemap indexes (`<sitemapindex>`)
* Sitemap indexes expand into **sub-sitemap tabs**
* URLs are:

  * Stripped of protocol + domain
  * Treated identically to `pages.json` entries
  * Grouped into batches of 10
  * Selectable per-group or globally

**Use cases**

* SEO-driven caching
* Large dynamic catalogs
* Align cached pages with real crawl structure

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### `pages.json`

```json
[
  "/all-artworks/fine-art/all-price-ranges/",
  "/all-artists/all-media/"
]
```

---

### `sitemaps.json`

```json
{
  "sitemaps": [
    "https://example.com/sitemaps/sitemap-index.xml"
  ]
}
```

> Sitemap fetching is done **on-demand** when a sitemap tab is opened.

---

## 🧩 UI Stack

* Vue (Options API)
* Quasar UI components
* Utility classes / inline styles only
* Modular design (sitemap list handled via subcomponent)

Main UI components:

* `DataCacheBinder.vue`
* `HtmlCachePages.vue`
* `HtmlCachePageHelper.vue`

---

## 🔐 Assumptions & Constraints

* Full control of the target website
* Same-origin required (iframes + file writes)
* HTML caching tested on staging/production (not local)
* Apache/Nginx configured to allow PHP execution in `/cacher`

---

## ❌ What This Is NOT

* Not SSR
* Not a CDN
* Not a headless CMS
* Not framework-specific beyond Vue

This is a **pragmatic, site-owned caching layer**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists

* Vue SPAs are fast — but invisible to crawlers
* Airtable is flexible — but rate-limited
* This service bridges the gap **without changing your app architecture**
